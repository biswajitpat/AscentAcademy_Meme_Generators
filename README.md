# AscentAcademy_Meme_Generators

# Live site: memegenerating.netlify.app

This is a responsive simple meme generating App made by using html , css and react js  .this  allows user to generate bespoke memes by adding hilarious or caustic captions to images. i have used HTML to create the primary platformâ€™s structure and input forms to collect images and text lines from users and CSS to make it seem nicer. Then, you must update the idea using JavaScript code and produce an incredible meme. You can add extra capabilities such as downloading, sharing memes, and seeing fit. I have used a meme generating api for fetching the templates for memes and we can create some awesome memes by adding text there.

This project has been made as a part of internship program offered by @AscentAcademy.![MEME]
